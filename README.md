#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted me to design a game that would be available for Android and iOS platforms.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did really well was figuring out the correct UML diagram for the game since the code to be worked on and modified was a very immersive experience.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I didn't find it particularly helpful as we didn't develop much of the code ourselves our even finished the game in this course.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I'd revise the Development Requirements and make the sections more relevant to the project.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why i
s it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs to the best of my ability into the software design. It is important to consider the user's needs because the software is supposed to be easy for the user to understand and use it. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I'd follow pretty much the techniques and strategies mentioned in the this course starting with a software design template to make sure all of the client's needs are addressed.
